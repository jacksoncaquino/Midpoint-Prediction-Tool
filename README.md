Automation of Market Pricing. Coded with VBA, Python, and XML for the GUI

One of the processes that used to take a great deal of time daily from our work schedules in the Compensation team was pricing jobs whenever a manager, an HR Business Partner, or a Talent Acquisition partner logged a case to have a job activated for a new location (we're in many countries). The first time I priced a job I had to open several different Excel reports, filter to get the data I needed, populate a template, and then start thinking and making my pricing decisions. Each job would take us about 20 minutes and the reports were massive, which would add to the time while Excel would freeze multiple times during the process. I developed a tool using VBA, Python, and XML for the graphical user interface to automate this, and as a result, we have a more streamlined process that takes less than 2 minutes per job.

It is made available to the whole team through SharePoint, where I load the latest version of all the reports that are used for pricing, along with the latest version of the code so they get all the updates whenever I improve the tool.

The tool is accessed by anyone on the team through an Excel Add-in:

It can price one or more jobs at a time. The user can type the job code and compensation market directly on the form, or select a cell or group of cells where the data is:
